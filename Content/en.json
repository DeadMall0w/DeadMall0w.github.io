    "more-on-me-text": "I started as a self-taught developer, learning the languages I deemed necessary to bring my projects to life (websites, games, automation, etc.), including C#, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I believe that learning never stops. I am constantly continuing to learn new languages to explore new possibilities.<br> <br>In addition to acquiring these languages, I have also learned to master essential development tools such as Git, GitHub, Unity, and Visual Studio Code.<br> <br>What truly drives me are challenges, whether in programming or in sports.<br> <br>I practiced Viet Vo Dao for 5 years and club paddle for 3 years (which I continue during the summer). These experiences taught me discipline and perseverance.<br> <br>In programming, this taste for challenge translates into the pleasure of coding a program under a tight deadline, quickly learning a new language, or solving complex problems on websites like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://leetcode.com/\">LeetCode</a>.<br> <br>I also enjoy the logic and strategy of chess. In summary, no matter the field, I always seek to satisfy my curiosity and turn complex problems into concrete solutions.",
